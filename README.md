# News-Article-Sentiment-Analysis


Identified 2 news reporting channels and verified if the reported news are based in accordance to the all-media bias chart using sentimental analysis.



(1) Fox News & CNN are the channels that i have chosen and they are aligned to the most right and most left in the all-media bias chart respectively.

(2) Web scraped the daily news from both these medias and exported it to a pandas dataframe.

(3) Used the data from dataframe to perform sentiment analysis.

(4) Stored the data that i had analysed the sentiments for in Mongo DB (Live cloud storage).

(5) Exported the data from Mongo DB to Power BI and created various insights in Power BI visualization.



It was drawn from this project that the CNN has reported news more negatively whereas Fox news has reported positive news. This was compared to all-media bias chart and the analysis proven that the chart's polarity matches to what i have drawn from the project.
